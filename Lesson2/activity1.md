# Activity: Getting Started with the Agent

## Step 1
Today we're gonna get started working with the Agent and how we can program our agent to interact with the world.

## Step 2
When we begin programming, the agent is automatically created for us. What we'll want to do is use the agent to accomplish tasks for us.

## Step 3
To get started, we want to add our ``||Agent: teleport to player||`` in our ``||Loops: on start||``.

```blocks

## Step 4
